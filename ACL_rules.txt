access control operation

callsigns:
prefixes in deny.db

CS: <callsign in blacklist>
AL: <callsign in whitelist>
SB: <suffix blocked> (the suffix block, such as GW, RPT, ND, is useful when using auxiliary nodes to avoid double queues)

this is the order in which the blocks are analyzed (the first condition checked excludes the others):
- blocked suffixes > does not pass
- callsigns blocked temporarily (timeout or wild-PTT)> does not pass

then it depends on the CheckRE (regular expression) parameter:
if CheckRE = 1

- if it is whitelisted > switch
- if it is blacklisted > it does not pass
- the RE is evaluated

if CheckRE = 0

- if it is whitelisted > switch
- if it is blacklisted > it does not pass
- otherwise it passes

if CheckRE = -1

- if it is blacklisted > it does not pass
- if it is whitelisted > switch
- otherwise it does not pass

other blocks:
prefixes in deny.db

GW: <gateway name>
GWB: <gateway name>
IP: <IP gateway>
IPB: <IP gateway>
SN: <radio serial number>

GW and IP enable the gw to listen, but not to transmit
GWB and IPB block the gw both in transmission and in reception, however managing the protocol, so the gateway remains connected to the reflector
Serial SN of devices blocked in transmission
